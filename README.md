# PDP-11 Playground

An(other) implementation of a PDP-11 assembler and emulator that runs in the browser.

Unlike the others, this version doesn't require an operating system, and it
designed to give more meaningful errors. It also features breakpoints, and it
can switch from the deult octal representation to either decimal or hex for
anyone born after 1970.
